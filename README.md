Some Instructions are also sent with this message by the Security System fitted in Vehicle to the Owner. In this message current location (in Google Map Link form) is shared.If We want to control the actuators fitted in Vehicle We can control with SMS messages eg: if we want to Switch-On the Anti Theft Siren fitted in vehicle we can simply send a Message "Switch on alarm" , we can switch off the alarm Anytime , We can also make a request to Send Current Locations continuously in a particular interval.
